# Investigating the Effect of miR-29 in CD8+ T Cells with single cell RNA-seq Analysis

This repository contains code for single-cell analyses associated with the paper:  
**"MicroRNA-29 specifies age-related differences in the CD8+ T cell immune response"**

## Code Overview
This project leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore how **miR-29** influences CD8+ T cell biology across different ages. The analyses include quality control, normalization, clustering, integration, visualization and investgating targeting signatures of miR-29, to examine transcriptomic changes associated with miR-29 regulation.
